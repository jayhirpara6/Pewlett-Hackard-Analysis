The goal of this analysis is to see in who are the bulk of retirees in the company and also see who qualify to participate in a mentorship program to allow the continue to grow and eventually replace those that were Seniors and Managers.

#### Results

###### As expected, given that there is an age requirement to qualify for retirement, the majority of retiring employees had either Senior Engineer or Senior Staff in their titles.
